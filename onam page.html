<body>
<p><b>Onam is a major harvest festival celebrated with great enthusiasm in the Indian state of Kerala, usually falling in the months of August or September. It marks the legendary homecoming of King Mahabali, a beloved ruler whose reign is remembered as a golden era of peace, prosperity, and equality. According to Hindu mythology, the god Vishnu in his Vamana avatar sent Mahabali to the netherworld but granted him permission to visit his people once a year â€” this visit is celebrated as Onam.

The festival spans ten days, starting with Atham and ending with Thiruvonam, the most important day. Homes are beautifully decorated with Pookkalam (floral rangolis), traditional lamps, and intricate designs. Families come together to prepare the elaborate Onasadya, a grand vegetarian feast served on banana leaves with over 20 traditional dishes. People wear new clothes called Onakkodi, and elders bless the younger members of the family.

Onam is also known for its vibrant cultural events such as Thiruvathira dance, Pulikali (tiger dance), Kaikottikali, and the famous Vallam Kali or snake boat races held in the backwaters. Various games and competitions, called Onakalikal, are held in villages and towns, bringing people of all ages together. Onam transcends religion and caste, promoting unity, harmony, and cultural pride. It is not only a time for festivities and feasting, but also for remembering heritage and honoring traditions. The spirit of Onam reflects the heart and soul of Kerala's rich cultural legacy.
