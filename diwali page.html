<p><b>Diwali, also called Deepavali or Deepawali, is the Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions such as Jainism and Sikhism. It symbolizes the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.

Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November. The celebrations generally last five or six days.

Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities, and personalities. It is said to be the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and remover of obstacles.

Other regional traditions link the holiday to deities such as Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.

Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by followers of other faiths:

Jains observe Diwali as the day of Mahavira's final liberation (moksha).

Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas, marking the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison.

Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi.

In Eastern India and Bangladesh, Hindus often celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.

During the festival, celebrants illuminate their homes, temples, and workspaces with diyas (oil lamps), candles, and lanterns. Hindus also perform ritual oil baths at dawn on each day of the festival. Fireworks are common, and homes are decorated with rangoli designs and jhalars.

Food plays a major role in the celebrations, with families enjoying festive feasts and sharing mithai (sweets). Diwali is also a time of homecoming and bonding, not only for families but also for communities and associations, especially in urban areas. Many towns and neighborhoods organize community events, parades, and music and dance performances.

Some Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs send Diwali greeting cards and boxes of Indian sweets to family and friends. Remembering ancestors is another meaningful aspect of the festival.

Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most significant and grand festivals celebrated throughout India and among Indian communities around the world. Known as the Festival of Lights, Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. It is associated with several legends, the most popular being the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana. Diwali is typically celebrated over five days, usually in October or November, and each day has its own significance. People clean and decorate their homes with diyas (oil lamps), rangoli, and lights to welcome Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. On the main day of Diwali, families perform Lakshmi Puja, bursting firecrackers and sharing sweets and gifts with loved ones. The sound of crackers, the glow of lamps, and the smell of festive delicacies create a magical and joyous atmosphere. In different regions, Diwali also honors Lord Krishna, Lord Vishnu, or Lord Mahavira, depending on cultural traditions. For businesses, Diwali also marks the beginning of the new financial year. The festival teaches us about the importance of inner light, kindness, and spiritual awakening. More than just a celebration, Diwali is a time for bonding, giving, and reflecting on the values of goodness and gratitude.</b></p>
