    <p>Fruit is a seed-bearing structure that develops from a flowering plant's ovary. While commonly associated with sweet, fleshy foods like apples and berries, botanically the definition includes dry structures such as nuts, grains (like wheat and corn), and pods (like peas and beans). In a culinary sense, "fruit" typically refers to edible, sweet plant products, whereas in botany, it is the structure that contains the seeds.
