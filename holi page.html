<p><b>Holi is one of the most vibrant and joyful festivals celebrated across India and by Indian communities worldwide. Known as the festival of colors, Holi usually takes place in the month of March, on the full moon day of Phalguna in the Hindu calendar. The festival marks the arrival of spring, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love and new beginnings. Holi has deep mythological roots, particularly the story of Prahlad and Holika, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.

The celebrations begin the night before Holi with Holika Dahan, a ritual bonfire that signifies the burning of negativity and evil. On the main day, people of all ages take to the streets, smearing each other with colored powders (gulal), throwing water balloons, and enjoying music and dance. Friends and strangers alike celebrate with laughter, unity, and joy, breaking social barriers.

Delicious festive foods like gujiya, malpua, and thandai are prepared and shared. Holi also includes singing traditional songs and playing instruments like dhol and tabla. In different regions of India, Holi has unique forms â€“ such as Lathmar Holi in Barsana and Dol Jatra in West Bengal. More than just a celebration of colors, Holi represents love, forgiveness, and the spirit of community. It is a time to rebuild relationships, spread happiness, and welcome the new season with open hearts.
