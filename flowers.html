    <p>Flower is the reproductive structure of a flowering plant, or angiosperm, and is often its most colorful part. It's a modified stem that contains the reproductive organs, which include the male androecium (stamens) and the female gynoecium (carpels). The main function of a flower is to enable sexual reproduction by producing seeds for the plant to grow new generations.</p>
